I increasingly hate computers and the world inside them that my brain is trapped inside of. That said, here are some things about computers. Let's be practical, with [another resource][1] to get you to stop screwing up shell scripting. Once you've figured that out, why don't you train an AI homunculus to reflect your own neuroses back at you, and start a conversation? It's time for a [vibe shift][5].

The unfortunate truth is that the digital world is the real world is the digital world. Culture and reality do not reside cleanly in a single realm; they slosh back and forth (an ass smashing into an ass, forever). The seemingly rigid schemas and structures in computing are in fact as plastic as our human messiness demands they be. As such: the definitive guide to [vaporwave text encoding][8].

The rich people dying in the submarine already feels like it was years ago now, but here's [this about the][3] totally unsurprising iniquity in the response and attention they got while a ship sank in the Med, killing hundreds of helpless people who could have been easily saved. Continuing the downward spiral is [Khloe Kardashian's pantry][2] as a wormhole into the trend of consumer capitalism bringing the drive for merchandising into the home.

In something a lot more life affirming, here are two short films about [people screaming][9] and [falling from a great height][10] (the latter tells less and shows more, and is better).

I am not a good writer. Whatever chops I had when I left university (the last time getting smarter was my full time job) have been eroded by the torrent of bullshit at the intersection of technology and capitalism and me-getting-a-salary. Maybe what will save me now is one of these guides for STEM types to get better at communicating: common [writing bugs][6].

What do you send to your loved one more often? Love letters or memes? Memes are [a love language][7].  Welsh and Albanian: [almost Romance languages][4].

Finally, the police are here and they say that you've won the [tiny awards][11].
