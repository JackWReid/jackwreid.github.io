I've been reading _The Art of Cruelty_ by Maggie Nelson and there's tons of great extracts and references. One that caught me in particular was this excerpt from _The Ivy Crown_ by William Carlos Williams, which (I _think_) disputes the rosy typical notions about love but reaffirms it as a wilder, more brutal thing:

> The business of love is<br>
> cruelty which,<br>
> by our wills,<br>
> we transform to live together.

It's a nice disputation of the oft-quoted 1 Corinthians 13:4-7:

> Love is patient, love is kind... blah blah
