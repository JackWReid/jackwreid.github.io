I left BuzzFeed two weeks ago and started at Kaluza the following Monday. The full implications of that are yet to be seen but for now they include: exciting new problems, lots of new people, nice new office, new cycle to the office through lots of parks, being a bit tired.

I&#8217;m a really simple creature. When people at the office asked me on Friday how my first week went I kept just talking about how nice the bike ride through Regents Park and Hyde Park was and how I was looking forward to spring. I think that&#8217;s partly because while I&#8217;m taking in a lot of new information about my job every day, it&#8217;s all still pretty abstract. A sunny morning in the park is not abstract.
