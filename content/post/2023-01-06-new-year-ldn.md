- I haven't felt sentimental about leaving London, I haven't felt like I need to say goodbye. We made a list of things to do in the city to give it a big send off, but we haven't been motivated to follow through with them. I love this city. I used to argue in favour of it all the time. Now I'm ready to leave it and barely look over my shoulder. Isn't that strange?
- I feel even less about leaving the UK. It's rote now but I have felt less and less like I belong here. I grew up here and there's lots of peculiarities about the British character that I think are interesting and worth examining. I just don't feel like I want to identify with it myself any more.
- I don't know if I'll ever be able to effectively shed my British identity, even I wanted to. Identity is, to a large degree, more about what *other* people see in you. I feel something like shame for the British identity that people around me will apply probably forever.
