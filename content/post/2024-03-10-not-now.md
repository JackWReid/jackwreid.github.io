For the past few months the days have been long and dark. Somewhere in the middle there it snowed and it stuck for a couple of weeks, slowly hardening into sheet ice. We're through most of it now. Last week, in the courtyard behind the apartment the trees started to bud, and now there's sun enough to catch the green rippling along all their branches. Spring, maybe. In the dark months I kept my head down and worked. Ugly, stupid work. Pointless work. Now just as spring comes I'm sick.

The other day I was in the office and I sat down in a meeting room and looked at the TV mounted on the wall, which advertised the next scheduled call in there. It said: *Content Item Service Product Forum*. How can that not be the work of a crude Markov chain? How can you not think of [the OSS guide to sabotaging an organisation][1] with bureaucracy?

Continuing the theme of bullshit, consider the architectural render of an upcoming housing or commercial development. Picture all the trees, the ghoulish figures thriving on their dog walks and willingly occupying the public space. Consider next, [the reality of the bare and cheaply cladded built space as delivered][2].

Here is, simply put, [the best writing about Formula 1 there is][3].
