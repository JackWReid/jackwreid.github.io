I might be getting back to work in the office soon. I always used to value the physical and mental separation of work and life. I think I still do and I’m looking forward to having it back for two days a week, which is the plan at first. 

A lot has changed since I left the office, though. I am much more invested in my home. For one, it’s gotten much bigger and can therefore accommodate work mode more easily. I also have gotten to like sitting in my own garden as I break for lunch and the flexibility of fixing some practical task in between work meetings rather than having everything waiting for me at home when I make it back around 7.

The chances are I’m going to get back into the office and I’ll remember all the things that made it great to be out the house for work again. Seeing other people every day no matter what, for example.
