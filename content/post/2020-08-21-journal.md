Some days are good for nothing. It's Friday and I've left work early but I haven't been able to concentrate all day anyway. I feel unhappy and all I can think is I should go to the gym or play the piano or practice my Spanish or draw something or... Instead I'm going to flit between things, getting agitated at nothing.
