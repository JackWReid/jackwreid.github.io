For some reason I feel really compelled by accounts of the crash involving the USS Fitzgerald that killed sseven crew members. It's a really interesting case of how the build up of lots of little decisions, shortcuts, putting crew under pressure, can lead to something dreadful.

I first heard about it in detail from [this amazing This American Life segment](https://www.thisamericanlife.org/634/human-error-in-volatile-situations/act-two-3) by Stephanie Foo. More recently though, ProPublica published [this incredibly detailed and moving account](https://features.propublica.org/navy-accidents/uss-fitzgerald-destroyer-crash-crystal/?src=longreads&utm_source=Longreads+Newsletters&utm_campaign=0d63afabd9-Longreads_Top_5_February_8_2019&utm_medium=email&utm_term=0_bd2ad42066-0d63afabd9-238547769&mc_cid=0d63afabd9&mc_eid=b40fd73cf8) of the incident. I love things that dig into awful events so meticulously. Another example is _The Death of A President_ by William Manchester, Secret Service agent posted on the occasion of the assassination of JFK.
