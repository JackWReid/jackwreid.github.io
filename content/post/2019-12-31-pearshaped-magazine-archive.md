When I was at university, me and some friends founded a music magazine and ran it for a few years before handing it off to the next generation of students when we graduated. It ran on for a few years after we left and then closed.

I noticed recently that the hosting was about to expire, so I exported the magazine's content and turned it into a basic static site so it wasn't lost forever. It's the [PearShaped Magazine Archive](https://pearshapedarchive.com).
