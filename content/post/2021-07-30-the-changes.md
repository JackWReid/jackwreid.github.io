There's been a gap. There have been some changes.

- I left that house alone and I crossed the river
- I miss the cat
- I cycle everywhere I go if I can
- I'm learning a new language for her and also me
- I live alone most of the time
- I've been off the island and onto another island
- I'm fully vaccinated against the virus
- I've sold most of my books (I still have plenty of books)
- I swim in the ponds; I see my friends for breakfast
- I'm happy and I'm not ill any more
- I'm busy; I squeeze people in; I squeeze them into my calendar
- I'm twenty-seven years old
