First off, here's a [DJ set I liked][1].

Right now a lot of people are talking about leaving Twitter ([here's mine][2]). Many of those that go ahead with it and turning up in Mastodon ([here's mine][3]) and talking a big game about how the collapse of Twitter will beget a golden age for the decentralised internet. That's nice. I don't believe it's really going to be that simple, though.

On the topic of decentralised internet things: the FBI seized the Z-lib ebook archive! That's a big pity given how hard it is to get ebooks without giving Amazon money. The Z-lib archive is not lost; some brave souls are maintaining [the underlying archive][4]. Here are some older, less illegally [shared files][5] including an account of the [fall of the Berlin][6] wall shared in 2001.

Now for some _~educational material~_. [This website][7] will tell you when and where to look for satellites that will be visible to the naked eye as they pass overhead. I heard they [changed the water cycle][8]. It's a lot more complicated that the poster that was stuck to the wall of my geography class when I was at school. This article from the Spectator (which is grim Tory hotspot I don't usually spend much time in) is a really good rundown of how [the Ukrainian language(s)][9] came to be, and how it relates to Russian.

Finally, here's a silly man from the past who [died a really funny death][10] in front of lots of horrified onlookers.
