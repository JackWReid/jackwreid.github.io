Dried pasta, soap, and toilet roll are high value items. There is much hand-wringing and shaming about who goes to the shops when and to buy how much (particularly the old and the medical front line). There is also hand-wringing about lovers trying to reunite before travel restrictions get fiercer. People are guiltily cycling around London and slinking into one another’s kitchens and bedrooms. The NHS are taking volunteers for logistics workers, who will drive medicine and equipment around, drop patients off at home when they’re discharged.

There’s a growing pool of people at a loose end, despite the fact that the government announced a huge welfare and business support package last week. I’m not getting laid off for a couple of months at least. I might use this pay check to buy a bike; Emma’s bought a kitten to keep us all company.
