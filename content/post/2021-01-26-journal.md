London had its first snow day of the winter. We set out for a run in the mid-morning when the first specks starting to stick to the frosty tops of parked cars. By the time we were circling a park it was coming down thick. The roads were coated with a layer a couple of inches thick and quickly became communal playgrounds for bored families. Sleds emerged. Where do the sleds come from?

After we got back from running I went to Dulwich park to take some pictures. We sat on a bench in the cold and had a burger and chips.

Last night was Burns Night. We realised much too late and had to scramble to make our own vegan haggis, which was a big success in the end. Leftovers for lunch today were a delight. We finally broke dry January with the last drams of a couple of bottles of good whisky.

Many outrageous Scottish accents were performed.
