I've been placed into self-isolation, it's been three days now. A friend of mine who I saw last week got a test after some very low level symptoms and he tested positive. He feels horribly guilty for the cluster of people around him who are now in self-isolation, which goes to show how much of this situation has been laid on the consciences of individual people, wrongly.

I've been doing okay so far. We've been playing Mario Odyssey and Ticket To Ride, and we baked a load of bread. I've never baked a loaf of bread before, even through the first wave (of the disease and the baking).

The weather was perfect for a run in the crisp autumn sun yesterday morning, and that's when I felt the first pang. Hopefully doing home workouts will keep me going until I can get out there.
