I woke up today and I was really, really tired. It's the end of the first week in a new role at work. I lay in bed until an uncharacteristic noon and having just gotten up, everything feels like far too much effort. If I'm tired or unhappy I can usually carry it around with me as I get on with things but I feel very _under_ it today. I hope it's not COVID-19 fatigue (the clinical kind, not the morale kind).
