In some other countries they’ve been re-opening society, slowly. Here things are fraying; many are talking about making decisions for their own mental wellbeing all government advice besides. On Sunday we said, “We’ll see what the Prime Minister says tomorrow.”

“…If we don’t do it by those dates, and if the alert level won’t allow it, we will simply wait and go on until we have got it right.”

“We will come back from this devilish illness.”

Today is Monday. We still can’t go and see our families or touch our friends. It’s sunny outside, with a strong breeze. I have a coffee and work to do.
