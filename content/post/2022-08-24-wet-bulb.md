We've had successive record high temperatures everywhere, but most importantly to me, in London. There was a bit of respite for a week or so but yesterday the humidity starting rising and today the temperature will follow. I don't think I'll find 28° intolerably hot after getting used to almost 40° a couple of weeks ago, but the humidity doesn't make it easy.

Hyde Park is parched. The leaves have fallen off the trees weeks early, which I'm told is some sort of survival technique. The high winds that saw off the last heat wave were so violent they cracked the window. I do feel particularly at the whims of an angry Earth god many orders of magnitude larger than myself. In the meantime, I try and keep the electricity consumption down, submit my meter readings, and brace for the next hike in energy prices.

Does it feel like I'm reading speculative climate fiction?
