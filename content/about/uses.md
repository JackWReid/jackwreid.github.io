## Day Job
At my day job at Miro I’m an Engineering Manager. I work from the office basically every day.

I use my company-issued **MacBook Pro “14, 2022** (M1). At the office, use a **Apple Magic Mouse** and the standard wireless **Apple Keyboard** with an ultra-wide Samsung monitor that would never be able to afford or accommodate myself.

I really like handwritten notes but I hate writing them up. When I'm making notes by hand, I don't use a bound notebook any more. I use notepads with tear away pages. At the moment I'm writing my notes digitally, using the **Obsidian** markdown note editor knowledge-base thingy. One type of note I keep is a daily agenda that I write at the end of the previous day.It’s just headings of the projects I’m working on with a bullet pointed list of stuff to work through. Writing it at the end of the workday helps me empty my mind of work when I go home, and reading it in the morning feels like loading a condensed version of yesterday’s work brain again.

I’m on MacOS Big Sur. The apps I have open all day every day are **Safari**, **Chrome**, **Mail**, **Slack**, **Apple Music**, **Terminal**, **Notes**, **Reminders**, and **Calendar**. My passwords are all managed through **1Password** and some work logins are managed by IT through **Okta**.

I used to use Bash to keep things simple but since MacOS started defaulting to **Zsh** I switched over to itI use **Vim** with **NERDtree** for all of my development. Towards the end of 2020 I moved into a more management heavy role, which means less time in Terminal and more time in **Obsidian** and then **Google Docs**.

## Daily Carry
My backpack is a black Patagonia Black Hole 32L, which I adore. My bike is a **Hackney Cycles single-speed in black**, which I hope is abundant and low value enough that it isn't attractive to thieves.

## Personal Tech
I've got a more detailed post about about this but in short: it's a Hugo site that I keep changing the hosting for. In long: [you'll have to read here](https://really.lol/post/how-this-site-works/).
