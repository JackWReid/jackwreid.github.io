## Day Job
At my day job at BuzzFeed I’m a software engineer, building stuff for the web.

I use my company-issued **MacBook Pro “15, 2016** (2.7GHz, 16GB RAM, 500GB SSD) but it’s basically always closed on its laptop stand next to my screen: **DELL 27” U2717D**. The screen is piled on top of a couple of thick hardbacks that were lying around the office. That way I can sit up straight-ish at my desk without having to try and buy a fancy desk riser. I have an **Apple Magic Mouse** and the standard wireless **Apple Keyboard**.

I write my quick notes on the back of scraps from a reporter notepad from the stationary cupboard. The messiness of this means I’m incentivised to type up stuff that’s important and ~~throw away~~ recycle the physical notes. That way I get a clear desk and text-searchable meeting notes and stuff. Right now there’s a note sitting on my desk with some Vim commands I’m trying to commit to memory. That brings me onto software.

I’m on MacOS Mojave. The apps I have open all day every day are **Firefox**, **Mail**, **Slack**, **Spotify**, **iTerm2**, **Ulysses**, and **Calendar**. My passwords are all managed through **1Password** and some work logins are managed by IT through **Okta**.

I use **Ulysses** to keep all my work notes in Markdown files, including a daily agenda that I write at the end of the previous day. It’s just headings of the projects I’m working on with a bullet pointed list of stuff to work through. Writing it at the end of the workday helps me empty my mind of work when I go home, and reading it in the morning feels like loading a condensed version of yesterday’s work brain again.

I used to use Bash to keep things simple but since MacOS started defaulting to **Zsh** I switched over to it, keeping my dotfiles almost exactly the same. I use **Vim** with **NERDtree** for all of my development (a mixture of frontend and backend web work).

## Daily Carry
I carry a tattered old canvas rucksack with my personal notebook (a hardback, dotted **Moleskine**), a **Uni-ball Eye Micro**, **Bose QC35** headphones, and whatever I’m reading at the time. I’ve got an **iPhone XR** in black, a leather card slip, and a fairly svelte set of keys on a keyring in my pockets. I almost never carry cash.

## Personal Tech
I've got a more detailed post about about this but in short: it's a Hugo site on Netlify. In long: [you'll have to read here](https://jackreid.xyz/post/how-this-site-works/).
