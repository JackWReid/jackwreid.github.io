## Day Job
At my day job at Kaluza I’m a engineering manager. I work from home four days a week on average.

I use my company-issued **MacBook Pro “13, 2021** (M1). I have an **Apple Magic Trackpad** and the standard wireless **Apple Keyboard** both issued by my company, but honestly I only use them when I go into the office and have an external monitor. Most of the time it's just my laptop on my desk at home.

I write my quick notes on an A4 pad from MUJI made of recycled paper. The messiness of this means I’m incentivised to type up stuff that’s important and ~~throw away~~ recycle the physical notes. That way I get a clear desk and text-searchable meeting notes and stuff.

I’m on MacOS Big Sur. The apps I have open all day every day are **Safari**, **Chrome**, **Mail**, **Slack**, **Spotify**, **Terminal**, **Notes**, **Reminders**, and **Calendar**. My passwords are all managed through **1Password** and some work logins are managed by IT through **Okta**.

I used to use **Ulysses** to keep all my work notes in Markdown files. At the moment I'm trying out going all in on the Apple walled garden, so everything is in **Notes**. One type of note I keep is a daily agenda that I write at the end of the previous day.It’s just headings of the projects I’m working on with a bullet pointed list of stuff to work through. Writing it at the end of the workday helps me empty my mind of work when I go home, and reading it in the morning feels like loading a condensed version of yesterday’s work brain again.

I used to use Bash to keep things simple but since MacOS started defaulting to **Zsh** I switched over to it, keeping my dotfiles almost exactly the same. I use **Vim** with **NERDtree** for all of my development (a mixture of frontend and backend web work). Towards the end of 2020 I moved into a more management heavy role, which means less time in Terminal and more time in **Notes** and then **Google Docs**.

## Daily Carry
In the time of COVID-19, the notion of a daily carry has shifted a lot. My lifestyle has change dramatically since the beginning of the pandemic. I don't commute; I work from home. I try and go for a run or for a workout at the gym most days, and sometimes that's the only time I leave the house. I cycle everywhere; London's gotten a lot friendlier for that. My bike is a **Hackney Cycles single-speed in black**, which I hope is abundant and low value enough that it isn't attractive to thieves.

## Personal Tech
I've got a more detailed post about about this but in short: it's a Hugo site that I keep changing the hosting for. In long: [you'll have to read here](https://jackreid.xyz/post/how-this-site-works/).
