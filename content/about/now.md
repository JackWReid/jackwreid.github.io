I'm living in Alt-Treptow, Berlin. I'm working at Miro. We're married.

## Reading
I'm reading _The Tenth Man_ by Graham Greene and a selection of novellas by Evelyn Waugh.

## Watching
We're re-watching _The West Wing_ as a sort of winter comfort watch. The latest films I've watched are [tracked here](/films/watched).
