I'm living in Alt Treptow, Berlin. I'm working at Miro. We're engaged.

## Reading
I'm reading _The Song of The Cell_ by Siddharta Mukherjee (because I loved _The Emperor of all Maladies_). I'm slowly grinding through _Homo Faber_ by Max Frisch with a German dictionary.

## Watching
By myself I'm watching _Barry_ and the final season of _Succession_. Sarah and I are watching (in decreasing order of attention-whilst-on) _The Marvelous Mrs. Maisel_, _Ted Lasso_, and _Citadel_. The latest films I've watched are [tracked here](/films/watched).
