In 2020, Iâ€™ve set [my Goodreads target](https://www.goodreads.com/user/show/54047855-jack-reid) to 80 books. I just about made it last year, albeit with some cynical swiping of slim volumes over Christmas to make up the numbers. As ever, I hoped I could read a lot of good fiction (my tendency is to fall down a rabbit hole of fiction on one topic). Events have since intervened and I've ended up very slowly getting through _The Power Broker_, a tome of a biography of Robert Moses. I also spent a month or so on _Stamped from the Beginning: The Definitive History of Racist Ideas in America_ too, in the midst of the renewed movement for Black lives in the US in summer.
