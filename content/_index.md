## Hi

I'm Jack Reid. I'm an engineering manager for BuzzFeed, living in North London.

At BuzzFeed I work on building websites. My projects there have been pretty varied; if you're interested you can read a bit more about my work history [here](/work). It's certainly a better account of me than my GitHub or my LinkedIn. Something that's a common thread through my whole time and BuzzFeed and earlier is a focus on accessible web technology, there's a bit more about that on the [work page](/work) too.

Outside of BuzzFeed my personality is unfortunately a thin layer over the last few things I've read, listened to, or watched. For that reason most of this website is a catalog of the media I've consumed and enjoyed. My degree was English & Politics in name but a mixture of political science, critical theory and digital humanities in practice. That's formed a lot of my interests ever since.

I track the [films](/films/watched) I've watched and the [books](/books/read) I've read, but I also post [highlight](/highlight) from articles I read online. You can even see what I've got [saved](/articles/saved) to read later in Pocket. I haven't really worked out a way to do something similar for music and podcasts yet, but rest assured I'm consuming that an unhealthy rate too. Read more about this weird media diet fixation [here](/media).

For some rare pieces of original thought, there's my [notes](/note) (think tweets) and [blog](/post).
