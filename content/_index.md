## Hi

I'm Jack Reid. I'm an engineering manager for BuzzFeed, living in London.

At BuzzFeed I work on building websites. My projects there have been pretty varied; if you're interested you can read a bit more about my work history [here](/work). It's certainly a better account of me than my GitHub or my LinkedIn. Something that's a common thread through my whole time and BuzzFeed and earlier is a focus on accessible web technology, there's a bit more about that on the [work page](/work) too.

For some rare pieces of original thought, there's my [notes](/note) (think tweets) and [blog](/post).
