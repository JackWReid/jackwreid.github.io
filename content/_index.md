## Hi

I'm Jack Reid. I'm an engineering manager living in London.

Here I mostly update the [blog](/post) and keep track of things I'm [reading](/books/reading) or [watching](/films/watched). I post few [photos](/photo) as I take them.

If you're interested, you can read a bit more about my work history [here](/work). It's certainly a better account of me than my GitHub or my LinkedIn. Something that's a common thread through my whole time and BuzzFeed and earlier is a focus on accessible web technology, there's a bit more about that on the [work page](/work) too.
