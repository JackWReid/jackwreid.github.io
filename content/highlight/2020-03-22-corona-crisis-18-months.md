> From a public-health standard, the pandemic will not end for another 18 months. The only complete resolution-a vaccine-could be at least that far away. The development of a successful vaccine is both difficult and not sufficient. It must also be manufactured, distributed, and administered to a nation's citizens. Until that happens, as recent reports from the U.S. government and from scientists at London's Imperial College point out, we will be vulnerable to subsequent waves of the new coronavirus even if the current wave happens to ebb.
