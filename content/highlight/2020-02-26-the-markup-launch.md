> You also deserve to hear these facts from an independent source. We want to investigate the ecosystem of data exploitation, and we don't think we can do that while shackled to it.  And so we make a privacy promise to you, our readers: We will not track you. Unlike many companies, we put your privacy first. We collect the minimum amount of data possible when you visit our site, and we will never monetize this data. We won't display advertisements on our site, because they too often contain tracking technology. This makes our work more complicated and more expensive-but your privacy is worth it.
