> Bitecofer's view of the electorate is driven, in part, by a new way to think about why Americans vote the way they do. She counts as an intellectual mentor Alan Abramowitz, a professor of political science at Emory University who popularized the concept of 'negative partisanship,' the idea that voters are more motivated to defeat the other side than by any particular policy goals.
