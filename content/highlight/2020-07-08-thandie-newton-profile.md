> What I am evidence of is: You can dismiss a Black person. If you're a young Black girl and you get raped, in the film business, no one's going to fucking care. You can tell whoever the fuck you want, and they'll call it an affair. Until people start taking this seriously, I can't fully heal. There are so many problems to feeling disenfranchised. But I keep finding myself alone. There is now an appetite for listening to women, but there's women and then, right at the bottom of the pile, is women of color. So careful what you do, everybody, because you might find yourself fucking over a little brown girl at the beginning of a career, when no one knows who she is and no one gives a fuck. She might turn out to be Thandie Newton winning Emmys.
