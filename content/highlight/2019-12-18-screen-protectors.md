There were a couple of articles this week about people behind screens undertaking pain-staking work to protect vulnerable children.

Firstly, there's [this article from The Verge](https://www.theverge.com/2019/12/16/21021005/google-youtube-moderators-ptsd-accenture-violent-disturbing-content-interviews-video) about poorly treated contractors reviewing imagery depicting violence and child abuse for large platforms like Google and Facebook.

Secondly, there's [this investigation by Bellingcat](https://www.bellingcat.com/news/2019/12/17/two-europol-stopchildabuse-images-geolocated-part-ii-cambodia/) that takes a collection of anonymised images from Europol and finds the precise location and date range in which they were taken through increasingly complex methods.

Tying it all together, I [just finished](https://www.goodreads.com/user/show/54047855-jack-reid) [Tinfoil Butterfly](https://us.macmillan.com/books/9780374538309) this week. From the synopsis:

> Tinfoil Butterfly is a seductively scary, chilling exploration of evilâ€”how it sneaks in under your skin, flaring up when you least expect it, how it throttles you and won't let go.
