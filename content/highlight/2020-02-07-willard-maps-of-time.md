> Willard's devotion to visual mnemonics shaped much of her work. In the 1840s, she published another elaborate visual device, named the 'Temple of Time'. Here, she attempted to integrate chronology with geography: the stream of time she had charted in the previous decade now occupied the floor of the temple, whose architecture she used to magnify perspective through a visual convention.
