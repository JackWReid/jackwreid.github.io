> The experience of reading poetry aloud when you don't fully understand it is a curious and complicated one. It's like suddenly discovering that you can play the organ. Rolling swells and peals of sound, powerful rhythms and rich harmonies are at your command; and as you utter them you begin to realise that the sound you're releasing from the words as you speak is part of the reason they're there. The sound is part of the meaning and that part only comes alive when you speak it. So at this stage it doesn't matter that you don't fully understand everything: you're already far closer to the poem than someone who sits there in silence looking up meanings and references and making assiduous notes.

â€” [The Sound and the Story: Exploring the World of Paradise Lost](https://publicdomainreview.org/essay/the-sound-and-the-story-exploring-the-world-of-paradise-lost#2-2), Philip Pullman in _The Public Domain Review_
