> I keep a notebook next to me at all times, like Linus van Pelt clinging to his blanket. When I get an idea, I put it down. I've had to stop on the side of the road to do this. I've put off eating to get notes down and write things, and I never put off eating for ANYTHING. Sometimes I get annoyed when I can't get the thought down quick enough, when I'm not writing at the speed of my brain. When I'm somewhere without access to a pen and paper, like in the shower, that impatience grows even more pronounced. I gotta make sure to catalog the notes I wanna make in my brain so that I can get them down the second that shower is over. I mentally repeat the thoughts to myself, like I'm reciting some kind of really dull mantra. Then, once the thoughts are down, they're safe. I don't need a lot of words to note what I need. Just a couple of scribbles act as a keyword search and brings me directly to the original thought.
