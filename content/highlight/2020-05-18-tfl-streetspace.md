> We're working with London's boroughs to identify places where temporary changes are needed to support social distancing or that would benefit from cycling and walking improvements.
> 
> To help our customers walk and cycle wherever possible, we're concentrating on three key areas:
> 
> - Quickly building a strategic cycling network, using temporary materials and including new routes, to help reduce crowding on the Tube and trains and on busy bus routes
> - Changing town centres so local journeys can be safely walked and cycled where possible, for example with wider pavements on high streets to give space for queues outside shops as people safely walk past while socially distancing
> - Reducing traffic on residential streets, creating low-traffic corridors right across London so more people can walk and cycle as part of their daily routine
> 
> Some of the temporary changes we're making could become permanent.
