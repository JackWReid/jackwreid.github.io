> I genuinely didn't know how I functioned before this system. Because I was someone who had notes everywhere. [...] It always felt like there was information coming at me from every direction, but at the same time I couldn't really find anything when I was looking for it. But now, with this system, I feel like I've got a little built-in secretary always reminding me of what I need to do.
