> I have no recollection of the books' literary merits, but I still remember that Kirsten, whose family immigrated to Minnesota from Sweden, lost her best friend to cholera, had to ride out a snowstorm in a cave with the frozen body of a fur-trapper, and then saw her family's house burned down by the baby raccoon she rescued (Changes for Kirsten, indeed!).
