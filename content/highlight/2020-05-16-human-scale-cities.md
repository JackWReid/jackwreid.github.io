> Sale goes on to list four ways in which cities should think about slowing traffic down:
> 
> 1. Cities should not try to move people to facilities but provide facilities where the people are.
>
> 2. Cities should be small enough so that inter-community trips, when necessary, could be managed either on foot, by bike, or with some simple subway or trolley system.
> 
> 3. Cities should attempt to slow down the flow of traffic, particularly with plenty of squares and plazas and parks, places where wheeled vehicles are forced to halt, endpoints that invite stopping and resting.
> 
> 4. Cities should try to bring home and workplace back together.
