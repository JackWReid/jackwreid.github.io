> One day I ask Robert Eggers, who directed Pattinson in last year's The Lighthouse-in which Pattinson plays a man driven to insanity and avian homicide by isolation and loneliness-why he cast Pattinson in his movie. 'Well,' Eggers says, from his own solitude in Belfast, 'that paranoid quality about Rob that you kind of feel in his everyday life, I think, is why Josh and Benny wanted him in Good Time and why I thought that he made a lot of sense in The Lighthouse. Although he's good enough that he can transform. But I think that paranoid quality is something that is special for him.'
