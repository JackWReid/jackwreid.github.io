> If you are in charge of a web site that provides even slightly important information, or important services, it's time to get static.  I'm thinking here of sites for places like health departments (and pretty much all government services), hospitals and clinics, utility services, food delivery and ordering, and I'm sure there are more that haven't occurred to me.  As much as you possibly can, get it down to static HTML and CSS and maybe a tiny bit of enhancing JS, and pare away every byte you can.
