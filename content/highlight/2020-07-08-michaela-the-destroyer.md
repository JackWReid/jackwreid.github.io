> Coel recalls one clarifying moment when she spoke with a senior-level development executive at Netflix and asked if she could retain at least 5 percent of her rights. There was just silence on the phone, she says. "And she said, 'It's not how we do things here. Nobody does that, it's not a big deal.' I said, If it's not a big deal, then I'd really like to have 5 percent of my rights.' Silence. She bargained down to 2 percent, one percent, and finally 0.5 percent. The woman said she'd have to run it up the chain. Then she paused and said, Michaela? I just want you to know I'm really proud of you. You're doing the right thing. And she hung up."
