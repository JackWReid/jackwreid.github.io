title: "Flag at Liberty Island and One World Trade Center. 🇺🇸🏛 After seeing what I did at the 9/11 Museum, I feel like I can understand what happened to the country way more. Still think where they ended up is messed up. But, when people in New York saw the stuff they did - it must have seemed reassuring for Bush to turn up and say he was in control and taking action.  You can also see why people were willing to give up all kinds of freedoms, just so that wouldn't happen again."
