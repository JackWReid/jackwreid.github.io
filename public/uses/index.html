<h2 id="day-job">Day Job</h2>
<p>At my day job at BuzzFeed I’m a software engineer, building stuff for the web.</p>
<p>I use my company-issued <strong>MacBook Pro “16, 2020</strong> (2.3GHz, 16GB RAM, 1TB SSD). It&rsquo;s on a Griffin laptop stand, which isn&rsquo;t quite tall enough to bring the screen up to my eyeline, so the stand is piled on top of a couple of thick hardbacks that were lying around. I have an <strong>Apple Magic Mouse</strong> and the standard wireless <strong>Apple Keyboard</strong>.</p>
<p>I write my quick notes on an A4 pad from MUJI made of recycled paper. The messiness of this means I’m incentivised to type up stuff that’s important and <del>throw away</del> recycle the physical notes. That way I get a clear desk and text-searchable meeting notes and stuff.f</p>
<p>I’m on MacOS Big Sur. The apps I have open all day every day are <strong>Safari</strong>, <strong>Chrome</strong>, <strong>Mail</strong>, <strong>Slack</strong>, <strong>Spotify</strong>, <strong>Terminal</strong>, <strong>Notes</strong>, <strong>Reminders</strong>, and <strong>Calendar</strong>. My passwords are all managed through <strong>1Password</strong> and some work logins are managed by IT through <strong>Okta</strong>.</p>
<p>I used to use <strong>Ulysses</strong> to keep all my work notes in Markdown files. At the moment I&rsquo;m trying out going all in on the Apple walled garden, so everything is in <strong>Notes</strong>. One type of note I keep is a daily agenda that I write at the end of the previous day.It’s just headings of the projects I’m working on with a bullet pointed list of stuff to work through. Writing it at the end of the workday helps me empty my mind of work when I go home, and reading it in the morning feels like loading a condensed version of yesterday’s work brain again.</p>
<p>I used to use Bash to keep things simple but since MacOS started defaulting to <strong>Zsh</strong> I switched over to it, keeping my dotfiles almost exactly the same. I use <strong>Vim</strong> with <strong>NERDtree</strong> for all of my development (a mixture of frontend and backend web work). Towards the end of 2020 I moved into a more management heavy role, which means less time in Terminal and more time in <strong>Notes</strong> and then <strong>Google Docs</strong>.</p>
<h2 id="daily-carry">Daily Carry</h2>
<p>In the time of COVID-19, the notion of a daily carry has shifted a lot. My lifestyle has change dramatically since the beginning of the pandemic. I don&rsquo;t commute; I work from home. I try and go for a run or for a workout at the gym most days, and sometimes that&rsquo;s the only time I leave the house. I cycle everywhere; London&rsquo;s gotten a lot friendlier for that. My bike is a <strong>Hackney Cycles single-speed in black</strong>, which I hope is abundant and low value enough that it isn&rsquo;t attractive to thieves.</p>

<p>I&rsquo;ve got a more detailed post about about this but in short: it&rsquo;s a Hugo site that I keep changing the hosting for. In long: <a href="https://jackreid.xyz/post/how-this-site-works/">you&rsquo;ll have to read here</a>.</p>
