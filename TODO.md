# TODO

## Infrastructure
- Look at the feasability of moving off of Netlify
- How badly will you miss the CMS?
- Look at GitHub actions and triggering a rebuild
- Dockerise the above

## Media
- Look at pagination or filtering for the longer media lists

## Photos
- Change the format of photo posts into real .md files rather than template tricks
- Lightbox the photos, with captions
- Different layout file for photos

## Interop
- Figure out posting notes to Mastodon
